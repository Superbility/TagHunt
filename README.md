# TagHunt

Tag hunt is a 3 player twist on the popular minigame "Minecraft Manhunt", most famously played by Dream

Instead of having one runner and 3 hunters, in this mode the hunters and runners switch, depending on who is able to tag who! Hitting the runner will result in you becoming the new runner, but be careful - they will try to tag you back!

The aim of the game is to be the player to kill the dragon but as a hunter all damage done to the dragon is nullified! Fear not though, hunters have a magical compass to assist in tracking down the runner!
